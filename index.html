			<h2>Bio</h2>
			<p>
				Finding his corporate finance day to day job meaningless and mindless, the bordem began to drive Paul mad. He
				decided to turn his hobby into a passion by immersing himself in the studies of web development. Nothing felt more
				fulfilling than the constant challenge of solving new problems regularly. Furthermore, Paul would love to employ
				his skills in the business world where he can make both a social and financial impact. On a less serious note, Paul
				also enjoys many other hobbies when he finds any free time in his schedule, such as playing the piano, playing the
				steirische harmonika, participating in the local community, and engaging in strategic challenges from board games
				to business negotations. Community involvement includes helping with Hurricane Harvey disaster relief and 
				other local non-profit organizations.

						This app was built to streamline group travel planning after my own firsthand experience with less than organized

						researching varioius potential activities actualize into
						concrete plans.

						Despite numerous online recipes and sources, they never seem
						to quite meet our expectations of our Moms' and Grandmas' recipes. The Recipe
						Vault was an idea inspired in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.
						Tradition and food was one of the last things on our minds at the time.
						However, no holiday seems quite the same without those traditional family
						dishes that have been passed down for generations. With the Recipe Vault, users are able to maintain
						privacy as well as preserve their families' recipes.

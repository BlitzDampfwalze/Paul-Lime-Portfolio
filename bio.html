          My Story
				</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
          As a finance and business professional, I quickly came to realize that my strengths were primarily technical. I would always look for ways to improve processes - usually through automation. This had to be done almost entirely through Excel as we had no other tools and no other expertise. Nonetheless, I often caught myself thinking of solutions outside of work and would explore some of Excel's capabilities.
			</p>

      <p>	
        Finally, I decided to start learning some Python and quickly came to realize how much I enjoyed solving challenges and working with the language to create solutions for simple redundant tasks. Feeling underwhelmed and realizing how much untapped potential was being wasted in my current role, I decided to shift careers. Though it’s actually a financial step back, I realized how important it is to truly love what you do on a daily basis. While I still enjoy making wise investments, my passion really lies in the problem solving and engineering field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I am a Full-Stack Software Developer looking to utilize both my professional business background and developer expertise to create effective solutions for the end-user. My background in business and finance enables me to easily understand the needs of my end-user and develop high impact features while reducing wasted time on unnecessary features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On a less serious note, I also enjoy many other hobbies when I find any free time in my schedule, such as playing the piano, playing the steirische harmonika, participating in the local community, and engaging in strategic challenges and board games. My most recent community involvement includes helping with Hurricane Harvey disaster relief and other local non-profit organizations. I also continue to expand and deepen my Computer Science and Programming knowledge as well as work on side projects.

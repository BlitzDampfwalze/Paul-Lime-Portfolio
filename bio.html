				<h2>About Paul
					<hr class="heading-underline" />
				</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				I am a Full Stack Developer with a passion for problem solving and process improvement with strong critical thinking and reasoning skills. I bring a holistic approach with my <u>proven professional</u> background in finance, business, investing, and technology.
			</p>

				<p>					
						On a less serious note, I also enjoy many other hobbies when I find any free time in my schedule, such as
						playing
						the piano, playing the steirische harmonika, participating in the local community, and engaging in strategic
						challenges from board games to business negotiations.
					</p>
					<p>
						My most recent community involvement includes helping with
						Hurricane Harvey disaster relief and other local non-profit organizations.
